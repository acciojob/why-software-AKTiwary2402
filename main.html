	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Software Engineering exites me. At the early time of my college when I was in first year, we studied C, C++ language from that time, I found myself interested in IT field. But after college as I wanted to start my career I joined BPO worked for almost 1.5 years, but this not exites me therefore I want to switch my career in software devepolment then I joined AccioJob and I learned Java programming language and Data Structure and Algorithm as well. Currently I'm upskilling myself in Frontend technologies as well.</p>
